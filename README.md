This module will build moodle on target server.

This moodle module is very limited at the moment.  It will download moodle from git, setup mysql and then you can complete the build though the web site.

Limitions:

  - mysql - Only the username and database name are variables.  For all othere changes then please see the params file.
  - No other databases are working at this point in time.
  - The confiquartion of moodle must be done through the web page.  There is no auto configuartion at the moment.

This is very early code, so please use at your discression.
